            <h2 id = "TheBeginning">3rd Grade</h2>
			<p> When the bruin school shut down I was going into 3rd grade. I had to get used to going to chicora everyday 
			for school. It took me a while to get used to the classrooms, and where everything was. At that time i didnt 
			have many friends because I didnt know many people, but eventually I met more people and gained a few friends! My friends helped me get used to going to Chicora.</p>

          <div id="music">
            <h2> Music </h2>
            <p>One time I came home from church and I had a song stuck in my head, I decided to look it up. When I looked it
			up I found the song on youtube and I listened to it, then I listened to one of the suggested songs, and I kept 
			listening to more of the songs youtube suggested to me, and eventually I listened to so many of the songs that 
			we sang in church that my youtube home page looked like this:</p>
			<center> <img id="youtubeHomepage" src="images/youtubeHomepage.png" width="600px"/> </center> <p> 
			This event was important in my life because it changed my perspective of how I saw Christianity, and it made me
			interested in the religion that I believe in</p>

          <div id="Concert">
            <h2> Concert </h2>
            <p>The first concert I went to was at the <a href="https://www.crawfordcountyfairpa.com/">Crawford County Fair</a>, in 2018. I went there to listen to one of my favorite bands, "<a href="https://mercyme.org/">Mercy Me</a>". It was the first concert I went to and now i go to a concert every year at the same place. I now love to go to concerts even though at first I was reluctant to go.</p>
